# wireshark-traffic-analysis-project
Capture, analyze, and document suspicious network traffic using Wireshark on Kali Linux, then upload findings and documentation to GitHub as a professional project portfolio piece.
This project demonstrates real-world network traffic analysis using Wireshark on Kali Linux. It includes packet captures, threat analysis (e.g., DNS tunneling, ARP spoofing, or malware beaconing), and documentation of key indicators and patterns found. The goal is to develop SOC-level skills in packet analysis and incident investigation."
